## Description

This dude started out as a proper Etch-a-Sketch, I swear. But as the project developed, and the desire to add additional functionality over took me...it became “more”. So much more, that it’s not even really an Etch-a-Sketch anymore.

It still shakes though, and that’s fun. :D

## Things Learned:

- Canvas
- Touch Events
- Downloading an image of the canvas with canvas.toDataURL()
- How to make a custom styled range slider WITH FEEDBACK INDICATOR ON THE THUMB....that works in Chrome, Safari _AND_ Firefox. (had to be a little hacky to get it to function in Firefox)
- Where to put the aria-label on radio buttons for screen readers (hint: on the input, not the label)
- How to tab through radio buttons and how to use a range slider with the keyboard. (arrow keys!)
- How to make an animation run only on button click with GSAP
